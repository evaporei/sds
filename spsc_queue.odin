SPSC - Single-Producer Single-Consumer Lock-Free Queue

This is a ring buffer which can be safely operated on by two threads:
- one "producer" which keeps pushing values
- and one "consumer" which keeps popping them

(in theory it's safe for both threads to push and pop at once, but it's probably not a good architecture)

There is no internal locking, only two atomic operations per push/pop.

Push can fail if the queue is full, there are a few ways you can deal with that:
1. ignore it and throw away the value
2. run push in a hot loop until it succeeds
3. retry push after some time if it fails, doing additional work in-between

In case you want to have more than 1 producers or consumers, you can use multiple SPSC queues instead of
a much more complex MPMC/SPMC/MPSC queues. You can create one SPSC queue for every producer/consumer,
and then the consumer/producer is going to iterate all those queues one by one, instead of reading from just one global queue.

This queue also doesn't support many of the same procedures as regular Queue, because the practical use-case
is very different. You should think about this as a "pipe" between two parallel systems, similar to what hardware does.

You should consider batching your pushes and pops and call push_elems/pop_elems with more than one item at once.
However it depends on your workload, it's a tradeoff between latency between producer and consumer,
and the overhead spent on synchronization.

The head/tail values are each on a separate cache-line to avoid false sharing.
I'm not sure if it's necessary to separate *all* of them, maybe tails could be shared
since they are both accessed by both threads at roughly the same time.
However the overhead is just 4 cache lines, which is nothing for a big queue.
